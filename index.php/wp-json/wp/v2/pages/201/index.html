A prime example of this emerging distributed ML paradigm is Google&#8217;s renowned federated learning framework. Despite the tremendous recent interest in distributed ML, remarkably, prior work in the area remains largely focused on the development of distributed ML algorithms for inference and classification tasks. In contrast, in this talk, we focus on&nbsp;two&nbsp;novel&nbsp;distributed ML&nbsp;perspectives. We first investigate how, when deployed over real-world wireless networks, the performance of distributed ML (particularly federated learning) will be affected by inherent network properties such as bandwidth limitations and delay. We then make the case for the necessity of a&nbsp;novel, joint learning and communication design perspective when deploying federated learning over practical wireless networks such as cellular systems. Then, we turn our attention towards the design of new distributed ML algorithms that can be used for generative tasks. In this context, we introduce the&nbsp;novel&nbsp;framework of brainstorming generative adversarial networks (BGANs) that constitutes one of the first implementations of distributed, multi-agent GAN models. We show how BGAN allows multiple agents to gain information from one another without sharing their real datasets but by &#8220;brainstorming&#8221;&nbsp; their generated data samples. We then demonstrate the higher accuracy and scalability of BGAN compared to the state of the art. We also illustrate how BGAN can be used for analyzing a millimeter wave channel estimation problem in wireless networks that rely on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). We conclude this talk with an overview on the future outlook of the exciting area of distributed ML.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Biography. <\/strong>Walid Saad (S\u201907, M\u201910, SM\u201915, F\u201919) received his Ph.D degree from the University of Oslo in 2010.
